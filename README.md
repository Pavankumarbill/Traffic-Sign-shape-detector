# Traffic-Sign-shape-detector
This project detects the traffic sign and its shape in the frame. It uses YOLO v8 for detection and opencv for bounding box 
<br> we trained YOLO v8 model to detect traffic sign in the frame and then used opencv to find countour and then find the shape of the detected sign
<br> we used [this](dataset)
